# Pete's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide has been generated to easily and readily identify organized information specific to web development using HTML, CSS,JavaScript and GIT.

- This project was motivated by the desire to more deeply understand each component of web development.
- This project was built specifically to explore the web development basics with first hand experience and document the fundamental topics.
- This project provides information specific to the most significant aspects of a web development fundamental topic.
- This project helped me better understand the JavaScript components and use cases.
- Within this project there are some "special" features such as "peteify" which allows the user to toggle to an alternate HTML version of the webpage that is more in the style of the greate eaqulizer, CHAOS! (lol) see the features and usage sections for more details.


## Installation

There are no steps required to run this project. Simply go to the web page to enjoy it.

## Usage

The topics and general information data is rendered in a list on the web page. In order to receive a study topic suggestion navigate to the DevTools 'Console' tab of Google Chrome web browser and review the message listed.

- The special features are launched by toggling the buttons when they are available. 
- "petify" is executed via clicking the button ðŸ™‚Click to Peteify!ðŸ™‚. When executed the user will toggle to an alternate HTML file that loads a fun version of the guide.
- "restore" is executed when the button becomes available after toggling to peteify enabled. This can be executed by clicking ðŸ’»Click to restoreðŸ’». This feature will restore the page to the standard page as defined in the prework-study-guide requirments "https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5336/modules"
- "Hide gif's" is executed via clicking the button ðŸ™„Click to hide gifs!ðŸ™„. When executed this will show/hide the gif's that intentionally obscure the content in to info cards of the body of the page. 
- "easter egg content" is executed when the user clicks the ðŸ¤“ you've found an easter egg!ðŸ¤“ button. By clicking this button the user will toggle to a tertiary HTML file that runs a DOS game, specifically DIGGER! (yay fun!)
